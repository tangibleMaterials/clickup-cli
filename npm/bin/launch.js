// Shared launcher used by the `clickup-cli` and `clkup` bin entries.
//
// The npm package ships these tiny Node launchers as its `bin` targets so
// npm's cross-platform bin-linking (which generates a `node <file>` shim on
// Windows and a symlink on Unix) always has a valid Node script to point at.
// The actual platform binary is downloaded by `install.js` (postinstall) into
// `bin/vendor/<name>[.exe]`; this launcher locates it and re-execs it,
// forwarding argv, stdio, and the exit code.
//
// This is what makes the package work on Windows: npm cannot link a command
// name directly to a downloaded `clickup-cli.exe` (the static `bin` map points
// at an extension-less path), but it can link to this Node launcher, which
// then spawns the `.exe`.
