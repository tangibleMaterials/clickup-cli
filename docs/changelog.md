# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `msrv` CI job had been failing on every push since it was introduced (`5f21db6`) because `Cargo.lock` is format v4 (default for cargo 1.78+) but the declared MSRV was `1.75`. Bumped `rust-version` to `1.88` — the actual minimum enforced by transitive dependencies today (`toml_writer` needs edition 2024 → 1.85; `icu_*@2.2.0` → 1.86; `comfy-table 7.2.2` uses let-chains → 1.88). No runtime behaviour change.
- AUR publish workflow had never fired for any release. Root cause: our releases are created by `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub deliberately does not fire downstream workflow triggers for release events produced by `GITHUB_TOKEN` (anti-loop safeguard). Switched the AUR workflow's trigger from `release: [released]` to `workflow_run` after "Build and Release" completes successfully. Also added `workflow_dispatch` with a `tag` input so past releases can be rerun manually.
- Bumped `KSXGitHub/github-actions-deploy-aur` from `v4.1.1` → `v4.1.3`. v4.1.1 is broken upstream (`runuser` rewrites `-c` as `--command`, which bash rejects); fixed in v4.1.2, hardened in v4.1.3.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Task ID auto-detection from git branch names (#8). Task-scoped CLI commands (`task get`, `task update`, `task add-dep`, `comment create`, `attachment upload`, `checklist create`, `field set`, `member list`, `time list/create/start`, and more) now resolve the task ID from the current git branch when no explicit ID is given. Matches ClickUp default IDs like `CU-abc123` and custom `PREFIX-NUMBER` IDs; standard workflow prefixes (`feat/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `bugfix/`, `release/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `ci/`, `perf/`, `build/`, `style/`) are stripped before matching. Explicit CLI args always win; destructive or ambiguous commands (`task delete`, `task link`, `task unlink`, `guest share-task`, `guest unshare-task`) never auto-detect. Resolution chain: explicit arg → `CLICKUP_TASK_ID` env → git branch. A one-line breadcrumb `"resolved task X from branch Y"` is printed to stderr on table output; suppressed by `-q` or `--output json`.
- Explicit `CU-` prefix on task IDs is now transparently stripped (`clickup task get CU-abc123` → `GET /v2/task/abc123`).
- Custom-format explicit IDs (`PROJ-42`) auto-inject `custom_task_ids=true&team_id=<ws>` on all task-scoped commands, not just `task get --custom-task-id`.
- New config section `[git] enabled = true / verbose = true` in `~/.config/clickup-cli/config.toml` and `.clickup.toml`. Turn detection off entirely with `[git] enabled = false` or per-invocation with `CLICKUP_GIT_DETECT=0`.
- `CLICKUP_TASK_ID` environment variable as an alternative source (overrides branch, overridden by explicit CLI arg).
- `CLICKUP_API_URL` environment variable to point the CLI at a mock server (integration-test infrastructure; not for end users).
- MCP server is explicitly **out of scope** for branch-detect because the host editor pins the MCP server's `cwd` at spawn time — branch-detect from MCP would reliably resolve the wrong branch.

### Fixed
- `clickup attachment list` and the `clickup_attachment_list` MCP tool returned HTTP 400 for every task (#9). The CLI was calling `GET /v3/workspaces/{ws}/task/{id}/attachments`, which does not exist on ClickUp's side. Fixed to call `GET /v2/task/{id}` and extract the inline `attachments` array — per ClickUp's API docs, there is no dedicated list-attachments endpoint; attachments come back with the task itself.

### Changed
- `task add-tag` and `task remove-tag` now accept either `<task_id> <tag_name>` (two positionals, explicit) or `<tag_name>` alone (one positional, task auto-detected from branch). Fully backward compatible with the existing two-arg form.
- The `[ID]` positional on `task get`, `task update`, `task add-dep`, `task remove-dep`, `task move`, `task set-estimate`, `task replace-estimates`, and `task delete` is now optional in `--help` output. Non-branch-detect behaviour of `task delete` is unchanged — it still refuses without an explicit ID.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Statically-linked Linux musl release binary (`clickup-linux-x86_64-musl.tar.gz`) for Alpine, distroless, and minimal-container use cases (#3). Runs on any Linux distro; no libc or TLS runtime dependencies.
- Alpine install section in `docs/install.md` with a Dockerfile snippet, and a Linux Homebrew entry pointing at the existing tap.
- Changelog now mirrored at https://clickup-cli.com/changelog/ via an auto-sync workflow that rebuilds `docs/changelog.md` on every push that touches `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Release workflow: run `cargo publish` on a clean tree before downloading build artifacts, and drop `--allow-dirty`. The v0.8.0 release hit crates.io's 10 MB upload cap because the prior order packaged the downloaded platform binaries into the crate tarball. As a result, v0.8.0 made it to the GitHub Release page but never reached crates.io, npm, GitHub Packages, or Homebrew — v0.8.1 is the first fully-published build of the MCP tool filtering feature.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `clickup mcp serve` now accepts filtering flags so the MCP server can expose a subset of its 143 tools at startup:
  - `--profile <all|read|safe>` (default `all`): `read` exposes only read-class tools; `safe` excludes destructive tools.
  - `--read-only` shortcut for `--profile read`.
  - `--groups` / `--exclude-groups` to include or drop resource groups (e.g. `task,comment,time`).
  - `--tools` / `--exclude-tools` to include or drop individual tools by exact name.
  - Matching environment variables: `CLICKUP_MCP_PROFILE`, `CLICKUP_MCP_READ_ONLY`, `CLICKUP_MCP_GROUPS`, `CLICKUP_MCP_EXCLUDE_GROUPS`, `CLICKUP_MCP_TOOLS`, `CLICKUP_MCP_EXCLUDE_TOOLS`.
- Filters apply to both `tools/list` (shrinks the LLM's context) and `tools/call` (rejects filtered tools with JSON-RPC `-32601`), so filtering is an access-control guarantee, not just a context optimization.
- Startup log line on stderr summarizing the active filter, e.g. `MCP: profile=read, exposing 52/143 tools`.
- Internal tool classifier mapping every MCP tool to a `(class, group)` pair with a CI self-check that fails if a tool can't be classified.

### Fixed
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): `cargo publish` now runs with `--allow-dirty` (build artifacts in the workspace were making the tree "dirty") and all three publish steps (crates.io, npm, GitHub Packages) now check whether the version already exists before publishing and fail hard on any other error. The previous `|| echo "skipped"` pattern silently swallowed the crates.io failure during the v0.7.0 release.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Rewrote MCP tool definitions for 134 of 143 tools to raise Glama Tool Definition Quality Score (TDQS). Pass 1 covered the 23 tools scoring ≤2.5; pass 2 covered the ~111 tools scoring 2.6–3.4. Only the 9 A-tier tools (≥3.5) were left untouched. Every rewritten tool now includes purpose context, usage guidance (with irreversibility warnings and pointers to safer alternatives for destructive ops), behavioural transparency (return value, cascading effects), and richer parameter semantics (how to obtain each ID, valid enum values, omission behaviour, constraints). Average `description` length went from ~30 chars to ~241 chars; target server grade uplift from C (2.8) to A under Glama's 60%-mean + 40%-min formula. Tool count, names, parameter names/types, and required/optional splits were preserved.
- Bumped `reqwest` from 0.12 to 0.13 (feature flag `rustls-tls` renamed to `rustls`; no code changes required).
- Bumped `toml` from 0.8 to 1.0.
- Relaxed `comfy-table` pin from `=7.1.1` to `"7"` (picks up 7.2.2).
- Relaxed `wiremock` pin from `=0.6.0` to `"0.6"` (picks up 0.6.5).
- `cargo update` across all transitive deps (tokio 1.50→1.52, clap 4.6.0→4.6.1, rustls 0.23.37→0.23.38, plus ~40 others).
- Synced `npm/package.json` version to 0.6.7.

### Added
- Jekyll SEO plumbing for clickup-cli.com: `jekyll-seo-tag` + `jekyll-sitemap` plugins, `Gemfile`, `robots.txt`, `docs/assets/og-image.{svg,png}` (1200×630 social card).
- Per-page `description` and explicit `permalink` on `index.html`, `install.md`, `commands.md`, `mcp.md`.
- `theme-color` meta tag in the layout.
- "Made by D3 Vitamin" footer attribution.

### Fixed
- Home page `<title>` no longer renders as "Home — clickup-cli"; now uses a keyword-rich title generated by `jekyll-seo-tag`.
- Nav links now target trailing-slash permalinks (avoids GitHub Pages redirect hops).
